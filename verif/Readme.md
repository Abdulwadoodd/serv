# SERV Verification using RISCOF
SERV uses the [RISCOF](https://riscof.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) which is python-based standard RISC-V Architectural Compliance Test Framework. This framework runs the Compliance tests in real-time on DUT and Reference and compare the signature results generated by both to decide if the tests are passed.
In our case, DUT is SERV core and reference is the [sail-riscv](https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv), which is the golden model for the formal specification of RISC-V architecture.


## Prerequisites

> :warning: Make sure to complete all the steps described in [Getting Started](/README.md). Once     it's done, start setting up the following tools.

- [RISC-V GCC Toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) - Make sure to install toolchain for native [`32-bit`](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain#:~:text=To%20build%20the%2032%2Dbit%20RV32GC%20toolchain%2C%20use%3A) build environment. Pre-build toolchain can also be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain/releases/tag/2022.09.21). Once toolchain is build or downloaded, don't forget to add the `bin` directory to `$PATH` variable.
    
- [SAIL-RISCV](https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv) - The reference model can be build by following [these](https://riscof.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#install-plugin-models) instructions. The pre-built binaries of sail-riscv is available in [`bin`](/verif/bin/) directory. 

- [riscv-arch-tests](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test) - Compliance tests are added as a submodule in `$SERV/verif`. Run the following commands from the `$SERV`.
        
        $ git submodule init
        $ git submodule update
    This will clone the arch-tests repository into the `$SERV/verif/riscv-arch-tests`.
- [RISCOF](https://riscof.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#install-python) - If you have installed [Python](https://riscof.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#install-python), run the folllowing command to [install RISCOF](https://riscof.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#).

        pip3 install git+https://github.com/riscv/riscof.git

> :warning: Make sure to export the root directory as `$WORKSPACE` (preferably in bashrc) and also make sure to have the directory structure that looks like following.

## Running Compliance tests
After completing all the steps in [Getting started](/README.md) followed by the [Prerequisites](##Prerequisites), we are all set to run the complaince tests.

:o: All the RISCOF commands will be run from `$SERV/verif`

    riscof run --config=config.ini \
           --suite=riscv-arch-test/riscv-test-suite/ \
           --env=riscv-arch-test/riscv-test-suite/env

- `--config` - Configuration file is passed using this flag which contains the paths and the names of DUT and Reference plugins.
- `--suite` - The arch-tests are passed to RISCOF using this flag. By default, it points to all the RV-32 tests. And it will only pick those tests from [`rv32i_m`](/verif/riscv-arch-test/riscv-test-suite/rv32i_m/) directory which are defined by ISA in [`yaml`](/verif/plugin-serv/serv_isa.yaml)
- `--env` - The header files of test framework are passed using this flag.

> :bulb: Other optional arguments of RISCOF command can be found [here](https://riscof.readthedocs.io/en/stable/commands.html#run)

When RISCOF run command successfully executed: an `html` report is generated which depicts the results of the tests. And a directory named `riscof_work` is created inside `$SERV/verif/` which contains all the log files, signatures, executeables for Reference model and/or DUT.
